Alkata v1 Structure
===================

Made by Starman (GoldenStarGamer)


This is the structure of the Alkata file format, which is used to store multiple compiled shaders in a single file, 
and easily expose certain properties.

This file format is designed to be used with the Arqeta Engine, but can be used for other purposes as well.


All data is intended to be little endian


Every Struct Array starts with an int that represents the number of elements in the array. This is followed by the elements themselves.
For Example: Shader[] is actually:
uint32 Shader# - Number of Shaders
Shader1
Shader2
etc...

fixed arrays are not affected by this.


byte[8] Magic - (0xFF, "ALKATA", 0xFF)
uint64 Version - for this structure, it is 1, this is 64 bits to allow for you guys to continue my legacy for years to come
ShaderDef[] - Shader Definitions
├─uint32 ShaderKind - Shader Kind, as declared in the Vulkan API
├─uint64 Position - the position of the shader code in the file
├─uint64 Size - the size of the shader code in the file

All of the shader's codes

int64 Timestamp - the time the file was last modified, in Unix Timestamp format, this helps with caching, preventing useless compiles unless the file has been modified
