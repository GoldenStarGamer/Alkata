Alkata v1 Structure
===================

Every Array starts with an int that represents the number of elements in the array. This is followed by the elements themselves.
For Example: Shader[] is actually:
Shader# - Number of Shaders
Shader1
Shader2
etc...

byte[8] Magic - (0xFF, "ALKATA", 0xFF)
int64 Version - for this structure, it is 1, this is 64 bits to allow for you guys to continue my legacy for years to come
ShaderDef[] - Shader Definitions
├─uint ShaderKind - Shader Kind, as declared in the Vulkan API
├─Uniforms[]
| ├─char[] UniformName
│ │// should we store the uniform type? and how?
├─uint32 Pos - the position of the shader code in the file
├─uint32 Size - the size of the shader code in the file

All of the shader's codes

int32 Timestamp - the time the file was last modified, in Unix Timestamp format, this helps with caching, preventing useless compiles unless the file has been modified
